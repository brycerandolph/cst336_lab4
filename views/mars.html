        <h1> Welcome to Mars!</h1>
    
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, 
        being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war 
        and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide 
        prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. 
        It's orbital period is 687 (Earth) days.
